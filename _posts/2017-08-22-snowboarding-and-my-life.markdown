For my major project in Software Engineering, I worked on the Meals on Wheels Project of St. Barnabas Trust, Dunedin. The Website is based on Node.JS for the back-end functionality and Pug.JS for the front-end. I was familiar with the basic structure of Node.JS application but I haven't really worked on any application purely based on Node.JS, so I was very excited to learn something new. The front-end of the application was based on Pug.JS which I found to be a little weird since I have only worked in HTML for creating page layouts and actually never heard of Pug.JS before.

We weren't given many details in the class about the project as it was linked to an external client via Adon. So we went to Adon to know about the project details. It is a simple website which allows the customers to see the meal options for everyday, customer information, driver information, the routes and the ingredients. We found out that the website is not a new one apparently and has been in existence for quite some time now. However, the website was still riddled with bugs even after a long time since its release and all the Software Engineering groups that have worked before us haven't done any significant work. It was a bit overwhelming at first since the website required a lot of work and we weren't really sure how to start working on it. On top of that, the website was written in Node.JS and Pug.JS which no one in our team has worked before. A list of bugs was handed to us by Adon and I was thinking that solving the problems on a website which was built by someone else could be very difficult. He also gave us the codebase for the web app which was pushed into our Gitlab project. No matter how much Adon tried to scare us, we were really excited to work on it. As excited as I was at that time, this was also a big challenge for me because any web application that I have worked on before was built by me from scratch. <br><br>

So the first thing that we did was to create stories of all the bugs to be fixed and the features to be implemented. We set up a slack page and a gitlab project page to manage our work. Our gitlab backlog was filled by all the stories and we kind of separated the stories based on how difficult each of them were into phases as suggested by Adon. So Phase 3 being the most complicated and Phase 1 being the simplest. Now work distribution is generally the next step but since none of us actually knew how to start working, we thought it would be best if we first go through some online tutorial about Node.JS and Pug.JS and since the two week holidays were approaching, we thought that it would be a good time for everyone to get familiar with the syntax. So, we setup our first milestone (my idea by the way) which was basically "learn Node.JS and Pug.JS" over the holidays.<br><br>

I decided to start the NodeJS Essential Training from Lynda because it wasn't very old plus it started from the basics. Sometimes when it got complicated, I referred to the NodeJS tutorial on w3 schools which had a simpler explanation. I found that the tutorial was very helpful in understanding the basics of Node and Node web framework such as ExpressJS. The focus on the HTTP part for getting and posting data from the server gave me a deeper understanding of how these processes work in Node.JS. There wasn't any good tutorial for PugJS except for the official documentation. In the meantime, I also tried to make sense of the codebase that we got from Adon but since we didn't know how to run it locally, it was very difficult to actually visualize what was going on. However, by the middle of week 3 , Hayden posted the instructions to run a local copy of the web app. After going through the code and making sense of it, I felt two particular things. Firstly, that Pug was very similar to HTML and even there are HTML to Pug converter available online. The second thing was that following the NodeJS tutorial wasn't very helpful and we should have jumped directly into the coding phase and figured everything in the process since when I actually got to the coding part, there weren't many things to relate to the tutorial and I had to google through the issues. <br><br>
