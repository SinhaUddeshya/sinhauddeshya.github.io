For my major project in Software Engineering, I worked on the Meals on Wheels Project of St. Barnabas Trust, Dunedin. The Website is based on Node.JS for the back-end functionality and Pug.JS for the front-end. I was familiar with the basic structure of Node.JS application but I haven't really worked on any application purely based on Node.JS, so I was very excited to learn something new. The front-end of the application was based on Pug.JS which I found to be a little weird since I have only worked in HTML for creating page layouts and actually never heard of Pug.JS before.
