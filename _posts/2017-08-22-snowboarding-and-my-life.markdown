For my major project in Software Engineering, I worked on the Meals on Wheels Project of St. Barnabas Trust, Dunedin. The Website is based on Node.JS for the back-end functionality and Pug.JS for the front-end. I was familiar with the basic structure of Node.JS application but I haven't really worked on any application purely based on Node.JS, so I was very excited to learn something new. The front-end of the application was based on Pug.JS which I found to be a little weird since I have only worked in HTML for creating page layouts and actually never heard of Pug.JS before.

We weren't given many details in the class about the project as it was linked to an external client via Adon. So we went to Adon to know about the project details. It is a simple website which allows the customers to see the meal options for everyday, customer information, driver information, the routes and the ingredients. We found out that the website is not a new one apparently and has been in existence for quite some time now. However, the website was still riddled with bugs even after a long time since its release and all the Software Engineering groups that have worked before us haven't done any significant work. It was a bit overwhelming at first since the website required a lot of work and we weren't really sure how to start working on it. On top of that, the website was written in Node.JS and Pug.JS which no one in our team has worked before. A list of bugs was handed to us by Adon and I was thinking that solving the problems on a website which was built by someone else could be very difficult. He also gave us the codebase for the web app which was pushed into our Gitlab project. No matter how much Adon tried to scare us, we were really excited to work on it. As excited as I was at that time, this was also a big challenge for me because any web application that I have worked on before was built by me from scratch. <br><br>

<p align="center"><span style="font-size:25px"><b>The Approach</b></span></p>
So the first thing that we did was to create stories of all the bugs to be fixed and the features to be implemented. We set up a slack page and a gitlab project page to manage our work. Our gitlab backlog was filled by all the stories and we kind of separated the stories based on how difficult each of them were into phases as suggested by Adon. So Phase 3 being the most complicated and Phase 1 being the simplest. Now work distribution is generally the next step but since none of us actually knew how to start working, we thought it would be best if we first go through some online tutorial about Node.JS and Pug.JS and since the two week holidays were approaching, we thought that it would be a good time for everyone to get familiar with the syntax. So, we setup our first milestone (my idea by the way) which was basically "learn Node.JS and Pug.JS" over the holidays.<br><br>
<p align="center"><span style="font-size:25px"><b>Learning Node.JS and Pug.JS</b></span></p>
I decided to start the NodeJS Essential Training from Lynda because it wasn't very old plus it started from the basics. Sometimes when it got complicated, I referred to the NodeJS tutorial on w3 schools which had a simpler explanation. I found that the tutorial was very helpful in understanding the basics of Node and Node web framework such as ExpressJS. The focus on the HTTP part for getting and posting data from the server gave me a deeper understanding of how these processes work in Node.JS. There wasn't any good tutorial for PugJS except for the official documentation. In the meantime, I also tried to make sense of the codebase that we got from Adon but since we didn't know how to run it locally, it was very difficult to actually visualize what was going on. However, by the middle of week 3 , Hayden posted the instructions to run a local copy of the web app. After going through the code and making sense of it, I felt two particular things. Firstly, that Pug was very similar to HTML and even there are HTML to Pug converter available online. The second thing was that following the NodeJS tutorial wasn't very helpful and we should have jumped directly into the coding phase and figured everything in the process since when I actually got to the coding part, there weren't many things to relate to the tutorial and I had to google through the issues. <br><br>

<p align="center"><span style="font-size:25px"><b>Working on Stories</b></span></p>
After receiving a list of priority tasks from our client, we divided up the work by choosing two tasks each. We setup a sprint for two weeks which meant that we were supposed to finish our stories within the two week time frame. I chose a story from Phase 1 and the other one from Phase 2. My Phase 1 story was pretty staright forward as I had to implement an option of deleting ingredients from the settings page because the user may not want it anymore and there was no need to have a restore ingredient option since adding a new ingredient again was very simple.<br><br>

Having an option of editing and deleting customers and drivers visually from the website and also an option to restore them back if needed was my Phase 2 story. This story was important because there was no need to populate the customer and driver list by people who were no longer active customers or drivers. I figured that this story was a bit tricky since it needed to have database manipulation so that the deleted customers are still in the database but just being removed from the site visually. I basically made use of the status field in the database for each customer or driver in the database. When a customer/driver is deleted, it is given a status code of 0 and I defined a query to show the list of deleted customers/drivers when prompted to restore using the restore button. The restore button is only visible when the administrator deletes someone. When the restore icon is tapped on, it changes the status of that customer/driver back to 1 again and the customer/driver is restored again.
I learned many things

<p align="center"><span style="font-size:25px"><b>Pair Programming</b></span></p>
I did some pair programming with Leighton on my user story. Prior to this, I always felt pair programming could cause conflict between the two programmers as they have different skill level and different ways to approach a problem. But me and Leighton had kind of the same approach towards programming which was to try a bunch of different stuff initially and observe the results. In case any error occured, use google and sites like stack overflow to get more ideas about the problem. In this way, try a bunch of different solutions learned from google and then check if it solves the problem. We never got it right the first time but that is the point I think. Mostly the reason that the code didn't work initially was that if we created a new file, it was absent from app.js. In this way, I think both of us enhanced our problem-solving skill and we did learn so much about each other's programming pattern. I learned pair programming could save a lot of time when tackling a problem as it did for us. Whenever I hit a dead end, Leighton examined the problem and vice-versa<br><br>
