For my major project in Software Engineering, I worked on the Meals on Wheels Project of St. Barnabas Trust, Dunedin. The Website is based on Node.JS for the back-end functionality and Pug.JS for the front-end. I was familiar with the basic structure of Node.JS application but I haven't really worked on any application purely based on Node.JS, so I was very excited to learn something new. The front-end of the application was based on Pug.JS which I found to be a little weird since I have only worked in HTML for creating page layouts and actually never heard of Pug.JS before.

We weren't given many details in the class about the project as it was linked to an external client via Adon. So we went to Adon to know about the project details. It is a simple website which allows the customers to see the meal options for everyday, customer information, driver information, the routes and the ingredients. We found out that the website is not a new one apparantly and has been in existence for quite some time now. However, the website was still riddled with bugs even after a long time since its release and all the Software Engineering groups that have worked before us haven't done any significant work. It was a bit overwhelming at first since the website required a lot of work and we weren't really sure how to start working on it. On top of that, the website was written in Node.JS and Pug.JS which no one in our team has worked before. A list of bugs was handed to us by Adon and I was thinking that solving the problems on a website which was built by someone else could be very difficult. No matter how much Adon tried to scare us, we were really excited to work on it. As excited as I was at that time, this was also a big challenge for me because any web application that I have worked on before was built by me from scratch.
