<p align="center"><span style="font-size:30px"><b><i>How often did your team scrum?</i></b></span></p>
<p> I would say often enough. Face to face communication among the team members was very good as we had a scrum mostly twice a week in every Software Engineering class and sometimes, even on thursdays if we felt the need. The purpose of scrum was simple - to inform everyone in the team about the progress made on the assigned user story, any obstacles faced in the process and future work. Scrum helped us to not only get aware of the work being performed by the fellow team mates but also to get an idea of whether we are heading towards the right direction and if the milestone would be completed in the given time frame. </p>

<p align="center"><span style="font-size:30px"><b><i>How well was your communication with the team?</i></b></span></p>
<p> We used slack for most of the team communication in addition to the face to face meetings. I think my communication with other team members was good but it could have been more better. To be honest, I wasn't very frequent in updating my team on slack but I attended almost all of the group scrums and discussed my problems there.

<p align="center"><span style="font-size:30px"><b><i>How was the team's interaction with the client and was the client satisfied with the team's efforts?</i></b></span></p>
<p> We worked very closely with our client Lynette. We had meetings with Adon who acted as the middleman between our team and the client to get an idea of the things the client wanted to see in her web app. In addition to that, we even had meetings with our client face to face to show her the progress that we have made and asked for her opinion about it. In the meeting, our client praised the work that we have done and even mentioned that none of the teams who worked on this project before us had made any significant progress or made an effort to know the client needs. After the meeting, we had a scrum to decide on our future tasks and one of the team members took the responsibility of emailing the client every week to update her. For the progress tracking, we had sprints of two weeks time frame in which we decided the user stories to implement, focusing more on the priority tasks first which were given to us by our client. One thing that I felt was lacking is that we weren't given access to the live site and hence it was very difficult for the client to see the recent updates that we have put in place.</p><br><br>
