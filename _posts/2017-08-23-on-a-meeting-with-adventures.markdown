<p align="center"><span style="font-size:30px"><b><i>How often did your team scrum?</i></b></span></p>
<p> I would say often enough. Face to face communication among the team members was very good as we had a scrum mostly twice a week in every Software Engineering class and sometimes, even on thursdays if we felt the need. The purpose of scrum was simple - to inform everyone in the team about the progress made on the assigned user story, any obstacles faced in the process and future work. Scrum helped us to not only get aware of the work being performed by the fellow team mates but also to get an idea of whether we are heading towards the right direction and if the milestone would be completed in the given time frame. </p>
